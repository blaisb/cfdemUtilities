This folder contains the post-processing tool for the Richardson-Zaki sedimentation test case

statsZaki.py :
    - Calculates the statistics of an individual case in time such as average sedimentation velocity in many directions, etc.

timeAvg.py : Averages the simulation in time to get a single result. Takes into argument a beggining and end timestep.

plotSingleCaseZaki : Graphic for a single case, that is mean sedimentation velocity with time.

plotTotalZaki : Graphic of time-averaged settling velocity as a function of volume fraction of particles


-----
How to postprocess a case :
    - launch createStatsZaki.sh
    - Look at each individual case using plotSingleZaki.py
    - launch gatherStatsZaki.sh
    - launch plotTotalZaki to see final results
